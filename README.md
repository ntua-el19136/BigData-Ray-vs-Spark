## Project Overview

This repository includes all necessary data generation tools and execution scripts used in a comparative study between Ray and Apache Spark — two prominent distributed computing frameworks. The study was conducted as part of the Analysis and Design of Information Systems course at NTUA.

## Research Objective

The goal of this project is to evaluate and compare the performance and scalability of Ray and Apache Spark across several categories of large-scale distributed data processing tasks. The experiments were designed to assess runtime performance, resource efficiency, and framework flexibility under various workloads and cluster configurations.

All tasks were executed on datasets ranging from 2 GB to 8 GB in size — beyond the capacity of a single machine’s memory — using a 3-node cluster (each VM equipped with 4 CPUs and 8 GB RAM).
